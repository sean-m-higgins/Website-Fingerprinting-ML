# Website-Fingerprinting-ML
Machine Learning implementation of website fingerprinting


## Presentation
Here is the link to the Google Slides presentation taht we should work on: 
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yGbqBSM7N9cy_UUAFvOsbbCi7Jp4Wk4sngm8Xq8vJkE/edit?usp=sharing

If you want access to edit, request it. Otherwise email me the email you want share access on.


## Setting up datasets
Clone this repository as is, but download the datasets yourself and drag into data folder

Make sure to expand the datasets into the data folder so that you see three folders labeled
- 10s_website1
- 20s_website1
- result

These all will be ignored for a git push in case we want to leave guidelines for any specific things to do within that folder


## Python files
We probably want to create multiple python files in the beginning so that we can test our results

I have done this so far by creting *clean.py* which is going to be creating a numpy array of our data
