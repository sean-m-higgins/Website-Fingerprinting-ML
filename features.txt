Our data has the following features...
    - Website name
    - timestamp (seconds since January 1st 1970)
    - Packetsize (positive[from] or negative[to])

It is our choice to chose what features we want to work with
So be sure to comment if you have any ideas


Both datasets include information about the direction of
each cell and certain management cells (SENDME) were
removed using a probabilistic method described in [26]. While
WANG13 provides only cell direction and order, WANG14 also
includes a timestamp for each cell. This timestamp is necessary
for extracting the required characteristics used by the k-NN
classifier. In our evaluation we also investigate different layers
to extract the information used to generate trace representations
(see Section VII-A). Since the required information of these
layers is not available in the WANG13 set, we re-recorded the
websites used with 100 instances each using our own approach.
This allows us to extract all layers of data representation (i.e.,
also those where SENDME cells are included). Additionally,
we can transform our own format to the input format of the kNN 
classifier and compare our results. We refer to this dataset
as ALEXA100.
